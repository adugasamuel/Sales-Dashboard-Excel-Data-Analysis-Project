## **My Approach**

This project followed a structured analytical framework commonly used in professional data analytics:

### üîπ **1. Data Understanding**

* Imported the dataset containing sales transactions across multiple categories, customers, and regions.
* Reviewed data structure and identified key variables for analysis.

### üîπ **2. Data Cleaning Checklist**

The dataset contained the following columns:
`Row ID, Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit.`

Key cleaning steps:

* I Checked **data types** for accuracy (Sales, Quantity, and Profit as numeric fields).
* **Handled negative profit values** ‚Äî corrected data inconsistencies.
* I Converted **Sales** and **Profit** to currency format.
* I Removed duplicates and ensured consistent capitalization.
* Verified **9,994 valid sales records** after cleaning.

### üîπ **3. Data Modelling & Engineering**

* Used a **flat-file model** (single source table).
* Established relationships through **PivotTables** for Regions, Categories, Sub-Categories, and Customers.
* Created calculated fields for **Total Sales**, **Total Profit**, **Quantity**, and **Profit Margin**.

### üîπ **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Steps performed:

1. Loaded and validated data integrity.
2. Checked for outliers and missing values.
3. Normalized category names and segment identifiers.
4. Generated PivotTables for regional, segmental, and customer-level analysis.
5. Performed calculations for KPIs and margins.
6. Visualized findings with **interactive charts**.
